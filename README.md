This project was created for a Nationwide Insurance Code-a-thon that I participated in at WSSU. The topic of the project had to be based off of "community". 
I chose to create a website to connect citizens in the Triad area to volunteer opportunities. The user can filter their volunteer niche to find opportunities that best interest them. 
This was all coded in HTML and CSS only.
